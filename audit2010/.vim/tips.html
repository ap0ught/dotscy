<li>Instead of <kbd>c$</kbd> use <kbd>C</kbd>. Same is true for <kbd>d$</kbd>.</li>
<li>Instead of <kbd>yy</kbd> use <kbd>Y</kbd>. Note that <kbd>y$</kbd> is something different.</li>
<li>Instead of <kbd>2dd</kbd> use <kbd>dj</kbd>, if your right hand isn't busy with using the mouse.</li>
<li>For quick macro recording use <kbd>qq</kbd> (creating a macro named <var>q</var>). But if you need to play it over and over again, keep in mind that you probably don't have to use <kbd>@q</kbd>: <kbd>@@</kbd> repeats the last played macro.</li>
<li>To delete a whole method, function or the like, you can probably use <kbd>dap</kbd> ("delete a paragraph"). Note that the outcome depends on your definition of a "paragraph" (see <var>'paragraphs'</var>) and whethere there are empty lines in this method. This is also great for copying whole methods or blocks (using <kbd>yap</kbd>).</li>
<li>If you use <kbd>&lt;C-LeftMouse&gt;</kbd> to jump between tags (for example in the help files), binding <kbd>&lt;C-RightMouse&gt;</kbd> to <kbd>&lt;C-T</kbd> may give you an enormous speed boost.</li>
